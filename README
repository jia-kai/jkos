This is the source tree of JKOS, an operating system
developed by Jiakai<jia.kai66@gmail.com>.

JKOS is just my experiment and practice, not intended to be really useful. It
is supposed to support multitasking and signaling, with a POSIX-like
interface. I only work to get JKOS run on my laptop with an intel Pentium
Dual-Core, so only X86 architecture is supported. And anyone is welcome to
join the development!

source tree structure:
/
|-- Makefile
|--	hda.img		image for hda (not pushed)
|--	kernel.bin	multiboot kernel binary
|--	initrd		initial ramdisk
|--	lib/		user space library
|--	src/		kernel source
